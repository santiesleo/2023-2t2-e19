## Integrating Task 2. Computation and Discrete Structures II

### **Authors** ‚úíÔ∏è

**Team 4:**
- Santiago Escobar Le√≥n
- Juan David Colonia Aldana
- Esteban Gaviria Zambrano

### **Project Objectives**

- OT1. Apply the functional paradigm in the analysis, design, evaluation, selection, and implementation of algorithms to solve problems with a naturally self-contained structure.
- OT3. Apply fundamental concepts of number theory in the analysis of computational problems that require it and analyze binary relations, particularly those that form an equivalence relation or an order relation, and apply this concept to problem-solving.
- OT4. Express or communicate the main ideas about discrete structures or functional programming with the appropriate/specialized vocabulary and language.

### Checksums, Checksum Calculation

A checksum, or verification sum, is a numerical value calculated from a set of data with the objeitve of detecting errors that may be introduced during data transmission or storage. The purpose of this project is to implement and measure the efficiency of the Single Sum and Dual Sum implementations of this algorithm.
